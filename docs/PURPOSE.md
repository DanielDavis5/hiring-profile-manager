1. Bob's presentation

    > Bob is a recruiter and would like to provide information to his client about Alice, a prospective employee. To do this he goes to his desk and enters a URL in his browser. A website loads with a list of profiles; one of them hopefully the person Bob would like to show to his client. As expected, Alice is in the list and he selects her. A beutifully formatted document is displayed with information about Alice. All readily available to Bob should the client have any questions.
